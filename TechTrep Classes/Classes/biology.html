                <p>
                    This class built on my previous knowledge and refresh my memory of biology. 
                    While going through the course I learned a few ways to retain information & study for small 
                    quizzes that were a part of the CK-12 Biology textbook.

                    Though I feel that most things went well with biology, I would say that I could’ve 
                    spent more time reading & studying the CK-12 textbook. 
                    I also would have changed my type of notes sooner instead of struggling during the middle of the 
                    semester when I got sick and couldn’t find what I needed or easily add to my previous notes. 
                    For me the labs were both difficult & easy, procrastination was not my friend for a few of the labs, 
                    but with other labs like the Insect Genetics Lab, I did very well.
