                <p>
                    During this course, I've re-learned most of the basics of web design; 
                    such as what is HTML & CSS and how they work. This class has shown me new ways of using 
                    CSS to my advantage, to create a smooth, user-friendly website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While it’s not something many think about, this course showed how organization can help with designing, 
                    creating, & debugging a website; organizing usually makes it easier to find a problem & fix it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though a lot went well with my assignments/projects, along the lines of time spent on the assignments 
                    & learning or relearning how to use things such as CSS Grid & Forms. I would say that I didn’t do well 
                    when it came to more advanced styles, designs & thoughts behind showing simple things such as tables and grids. 
                    <br> I also turned in a lot of my work late due to an illness in the middle of the semester, I didn’t have any 
                    real working plans to catch up quickly or have any wiggle room because I didn’t have some assignments or discussions 
                    ready beforehand. Once again learning the new limits I have while healing from an injury.

                    During the last few weeks of this course I have been working on my student portfolio from scratch,
