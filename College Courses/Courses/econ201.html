                <p>
                    During this Course I learned about Macroeconomics and how banks, the federal system, and the community can play parts in the money supply.

                    This was my only online college course at CWI, I found learning pretty easy and didnâ€™t struggle too much 
                    with studying & taking notes on the videos (the ones used to teach). 
                    Though I did struggle with some procrastination when it came to some of the projects and anxiety while working on a group project. 
                    I would have liked to study more & spend more time with my notes before my quizzes & tests. 
                    Although I still have to make some improvements I think I did well for my first online college course.
