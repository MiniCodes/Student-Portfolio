                <p>
                    This is a CWI course that I've been taking for my first fall semester with CWI; 
                    it's also a course that has two focuses, one that's a general 
                    "welcome to CWI" teachings & the other being a more chosen focus (by students).

                    Because I've picked "The New Dystopian Hero" as my chosen focus, 
                    I've learned about the history of Dystopian literature, Allegories, Utopians, & the Hero's Journey. 
                    I have also learned about the available resources & programs at CWI; with this, 
                    there was also a focus on taking take of yourself to perform better academically.

                    This course has also taught different reading, test-taking, & note-taking strategies, 
                    to help students perform better academically, reduce anxiety, & improve working memory.
