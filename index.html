                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Aunna. 
                    This year I’m a Junior attending TechTrep High while taking dual-credit 
                    classes at the College of Western Idaho.

                    I’m creative and curious, so I ended up with a wide range of interests and knowledge, 
                    from horseback riding to digital art & design work. I have knowledge of music/singing, 
                    photography, and some knowledge of Python. Though I do have a love of writing and reading, 
                    being interested in more mysterious, fantasy types of literature.

                    Currently, I’m working towards bettering my web design skills while also working on 
                    digital art & graphic design.

                    My goals are a mix between personal and academic, as this year I ended up with

                    Though my achievements for this year are somewhat small I’m proud of myself for making

                <h3>Strengths</h3>

                <p>
                    I see the below as my strengths though in some contexts they can also be a weakness. 
                    Most of my strengths have to deal with my curiosity and creativity since I notice these the most.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Organization (my own style of organization both digitally & physically)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creativity (contributes to my design work, organization & way of life)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Curiosity (makes learning new things easier & helps when getting to know people/making connections)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Range of (Random) Knowledge (lets me work towards certain life goals & 
                        allows me to learn new things/topics easier)
